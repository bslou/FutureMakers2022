I have learned about numpy arrays today. I also learned how to use math and python together. I realized that this process was not as hard as I originally imagined. In general, I really enjoyed this lesson. It is crazy how on the first day I already learned some basic AI skills like numpy arrays and pandas dataframes and series.
