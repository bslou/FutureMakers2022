Day 1 Reflection: I have learned about numpy arrays today. I also learned how to use math and python together. I realized that this process was not as hard as I originally imagined. In general, I really enjoyed this lesson. It is crazy how on the first day I already learned some basic AI skills like numpy arrays and pandas dataframes and series.

Day 2 Reflection: I have learned todays how to visualize model data better with various libraries. I also learned about different computer learning types such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. I also learned how to fit data using RandomForestClassier API, and learned more about decision trees.

Day 3 Reflection: Today I learned about tensors and libraries, and I improved my numpy skills, and learned more libraries for decision trees, such as linearregression. I also learned about how to add layers, and how it impacts the accuracy of the prediction results. Furthermore, I learned how to better visualize data using matplotlib.py!
