Day 1 Reflection: I have learned about numpy arrays today. I also learned how to use math and python together. I realized that this process was not as hard as I originally imagined. In general, I really enjoyed this lesson. It is crazy how on the first day I already learned some basic AI skills like numpy arrays and pandas dataframes and series.

Day 2 Reflection: I have learned todays how to visualize model data better with various libraries. I also learned about different computer learning types such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. I also learned how to fit data using RandomForestClassier API, and learned more about decision trees.

Day 3 Reflection: Today I learned about tensors and libraries, and I improved my numpy skills, and learned more libraries for decision trees, such as linearregression. I also learned about how to add layers, and how it impacts the accuracy of the prediction results. Furthermore, I learned how to better visualize data using matplotlib.py!

Day 4 Reflection: Today I learned more about how to predict images, and how to graph and predict data. I learned about tf.keras, and became better at using tensorflow and the prediction model.

Day 5 Reflection: Today I learned about what a neural network is, and how it is composed of an input, hidden layers, and output. I also learned that hidden layers help the prediction model predict the results better. I also learned about how hyperparameters such as layers, epoch, learning rate, and dimensions impact the learning. Furthermore, I learned where to use RELU, sigmoid, and softmax.

Day 6 Reflection: Today we learned about convoluting neural networks, and how they are used in image analysis. We learned about how the images are decreased dimensionally in order to help the machine learn easier. We also learned about max pooling, and various other lessons such as reducing overfitting and reducing computational load. We also learned about transforming images, and what a kernel is in AI.

Day 7 Reflection: Today we learned about the importance of avoiding bias data. For our collab notebook, we played a hiring game, where we would hire people based on their statistics. Little did we realize, the color of the people was also getting read in the machine. In this activity, I realized that it is really important to sample many people randomly, and avoid as much bias as possible.

Day 8 Reflection: Today we learned about the different layers such as batch normalized layers and droput layers. I learned more about how to analyze images and about convolutional neural networks!
